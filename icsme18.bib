Although some tools and ideas have been proposed to solve the evolution of APIs, most updates are done manually. To better understand the requirements for migration tools we studied the API changes of three frameworks and one library. We discovered that the changes that break existing applications are not random, but they tend to fall into particular categories. Over 80% of these changes are refactorings. This suggests that refactoring-based migration tools should be used to update applications.},

In this paper we explore the use of graph rewriting for specifying refactorings and their effect on programs. We introduce a graph representation for programs and show how two representative refactorings can be expressed by graph productions. Then we demonstrate that it is possible to prove that refactorings preserve certain program properties, and that graph rewriting is a suitable formalism for such proofs.

	abstract = {Refactorings are behavior-preserving program transformations that automate design evolution in
object-oriented applications. Three kinds of design evolution are: schema transformations, design pattern microarchitectures,
and the hot-spot-driven-approach. This research shows that all three are automatable with refactorings.
A comprehensive list of refactorings for design evolution is provided and an analysis of supported schema transformations,
design patterns, and hot-spot meta patterns is presented. Further, we evaluate whether refactoring
technology can be transferred to the mainstream by restructuring non-trivial CCC applications. The applications
that we examine were evolved manually by software engineers. We show that an equivalent evolution could be
reproduced significantly faster and cheaper by applying a handful of general-purpose refactorings. In one application,
over 14K lines of code were transformed automatically that otherwise would have been coded by hand.
Our experiments identify benefits, limitations, and topics of further research related to the transfer of refactoring
technology to a production environment.},

@inproceedings{Balaban'05,
	abstract = {As object-oriented class libraries evolve, classes are occasionally deprecated in favor of
	others with roughly the same functionality. In Java's standard libraries, for example, class Hashtable
	has been superseded by HashMap, and Iterator is now preferred over Enumeration. Migrating client
	applications to use the new idioms is often desirable, but making the required changes to declarations
	and allocation sites can be quite labor-intensive. Moreover, migration becomes complicated---and sometimes
	impossible---if an application interacts with external components, if a legacy class is not completely
	equivalent to its replacement, or if multiple interdependent classes must be migrated simultaneously. We
	present an approach in which mappings between legacy classes and their replacements are specified by
	the programmer. Then, an analysis based on type constraints determines where declarations and allocation
	sites can be updated. The method was implemented in Eclipse, and evaluated on a number of Java
	applications. On average, our tool could migrate more than 90% of the references to legacy classes.},

@phdthesis{Roberts'99,
	abstract = {One of the important ways to make software soft, (i.e., easy to change, reuse, and develop), is to automate the various program transformations that occur as software evolves. Automating
refactorings is hard because a refactoring tool must be both fast and reliable, but program analysis is often undecidable. This dissertation describes several ways to make a refactoring tool that is both fast enough and reliable enough to be useful.
First, it gives a new denition of refactoring that focuses on preconditions and postconditions of the refactorings, rather than on the program transformation itself. Preconditions are assertions that a program must satisfy for the refactoring to be applied, and postconditions specify how the assertions are transformed by the refactoring. The postconditions can
be used for several purposes: to reduce the amount of analysis that later refactorings must perform, to derive preconditions of composite refactorings, and to calculate dependencies between refactorings. These techniques can be used in a refactoring tool to support undo,
user-dened composite refactorings, and multi-user refactoring.

This dissertation also examines techniques for using runtime analysis to assist refactoring, presents the design of the Refactoring Browser, a refactoring tool for Smalltalk that is used by commercial software developers, and identifies the criteria that are necessary for any refactoring tool to succeed.},

@phdthesis{Opdyke'92,
	abstract = {This thesis denes a set of program restructuring operations (refactorings) that support the
design, evolution and reuse of object-oriented application frameworks.
The focus of the thesis is on automating the refactorings in a way that preserves the behavior
of a program. The refactorings are dened to be behavior preserving, provided that their
preconditions are met. Most of the refactorings are simple to implement and it is almost trivial
to show that they are behavior preserving. However, for a few refactorings, one or more of their
preconditions are in general undecidable. Fortunately, for some cases it can be determined
whether these refactorings can be applied safely.
Three of the most complex refactorings are dened in detail: generalizing the inheritance
hierarchy, specializing the inheritance hierarchy and using aggregations to model the relationships
among classes. These operations are decomposed into more primitive parts, and the
power of these operations is discussed from the perspectives of automatability and usefulness
in supporting design.
Two design constraints needed in refactoring are class invariants and exclusive components.
These constraints are needed to ensure that behavior is preserved across some refactorings.
This thesis gives some conservative algorithms for determining whether a program satises
these constraints, and describes how to use this design information to refactor a program.},

	the purposes of malicious code detection in COTS components. By operating
	directly on binary code without any assumption on the availability
	of source code, our approach is realistic and appropriate for the
	analysis of COTS software products. To be able to reason on such
	low-level code, we need a suite of program transformations that aim
	to get a high level imperative representation of the code. The intention
	is to significantly improve the analysability while preserving the
	original semantics. Next we apply slicing techniques to extract those
	code fragments that are critical from the security standpoint. Finally,
	these fragments are subjected to verification against behavioral
	specifications to statically decide whether they exhibit malicious
	behaviors or not},

	The use of automated analysis always results in false reports, however
	these can be minimized by proper specification of recognition criteria.
	Current analysis approaches fail to provide sufficient support for
	the recognizing the temporal component of log analysis. Temporal
	recognition of event sequences fall into distinct patterns that can
	be used to reduce false alerts and improve the efficiency of response

	method that could be used by an attacker to undermine an anomaly-based
	intrusion detection system. This paper shows how an adversary can
	craft an offensive mechanism that renders an anomaly-based intrusion
	detector blind to the presence of on-going, common attacks. It presents
	a method that identifies the weaknesses of an anomaly-based intrusion
	detector, and shows how an attacker can manipulate common attacks
	to exploit those weaknesses. The paper explores the implications
