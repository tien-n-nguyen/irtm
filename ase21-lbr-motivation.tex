\textbf{Summary}:  [memory] Traditional and Floating Point Renderings: view is initially empty

\textbf{Description}: This happens in both the Memory and Memory Browser views, for Traditional and Floating Point renderings. 

When a new Memory Browser view is created, or when a new rendering is created in the Memory view using one of these renderings, the view is initially not populated. It then becomes populated when a refresh occurs, for example by re-sizing the view. See attached screenshot for an example.

%\section{Motivating Example}
%\label{sec:example}

Let us explain an example of duplicate bug reports that motivate our
approach.
%Generally, a bug report is a record in a bug-tracking
%repository of a project, containing the descriptions on the
%bug(s).
A bug record contains the following important fields 1) a unique ID
of the report (\textbf{\sf ID}), reported date (\textbf{\sf
  ReportedDate}), the reporter (\textbf{\sf Reporter}), and a short
summary (\textbf{\sf Summary}) and a full description (\textbf{\sf
  Description}).

%\vspace{0.05in}\noindent\textbf{Observations on a bug report}
Figure~\ref{fig:br1} displays an example of an already-fixed bug
report in Eclipse project. As shown, this bug report was assigned the
ID of 488105 and reported on 02/19/2016 by Marc Dumais for a bug on
Eclipse. It described that the initial view or initial rendering for
memory browser is not populated. When it becomes populated when a
refresh occurs. Figure~\ref{fig:br2} presents bug report ID 493035,
filed on 05/04/2016 by a different reporter, Marc-Andre Laperle. This
report was determined as reporting the same bug as in bug report
488105.

%===
%Analyzing the textual description, we have the following observations:

%\begin{enumerate}

%\item This report is about two technical functions in Eclipse:
%  \emph{memory browser} (MEM) and \emph{view management} (VM) of
%  software artifacts. In general, MEM involves the operations such as
%  \emph{create}, \emph{render}, and \emph{populate}. VM involves the
%  operations such as {\em refresh}, {\em resize}, {\em rendering},~etc.

%\item The bug occurred in the code implementing memory browsing. That
%  is, the operation {\em rendering}  on an initial view
%   was incorrectly implemented.

%\item In this bug report, the technical function MEM can be recognized
%  in its contents via the words that are relevant to memory browsing
%  such as \code{rendering}, \code{view}, \code{create}, \code{populate},
%  \code{floating}, and \code{memory}.
%  Similarly, the description also contains relevant terms to VM such
%  as \code{refresh}, \code{resize}, and \code{rendering}. Note that,
%  some words such as \code{rendering} and \code{view} are used to
%  describe both functions MEM and VM. If considering bug reports as
%  textual documents, we can view the described technical functions as
%  the \textbf{topics} of those documents.

%\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Resolution}:DUPLICATE

\textbf{Summary}: [GTK3] CDT Memory Browser initially blank

\textbf{Description}: 
Using I20160504-0035
CDT master as of today
Ubuntu 16.04 and Fedora 23 (GTK 3.18.9)
C/C++ Memory View Enhancements feature installed

1. Create a hello world C++ project
2. Start debugging
3. Open the memory browser
4. Enter main in the address field. The memory view is blank.
If the view is resized, it gets populated correctly. This works correctly in GTK2.

%\noindent\textbf{Observations on a duplicate bug report}



%Analyzing the contents of 493035 and comparing to those of 488105, we
%can see that

%\begin{enumerate}

%\item BR 493035 also describes two aspects/functions: MEM - memory
%  browsing and VM - view management. MEM was also reported to contain
%  bug(s).

%\item The terms that are used to describe MEM are similar to those in
%  BR 488105, e.g., \code{memory}, \code{browser}, and
%  \code{initially}. The terms describing VM are somewhat similar
%  such as \code{view}, \code{resize}, and \code{populate}.

%\item BR 493035 provides additional information about the bug such as
%  the OS and the feature under which the bug occurred (Ubuntu, Fedora,
%  Memory View Enhancements, address field). It also provides the steps
%  to reproduce the bug. The text contains those additional terms. It
%  mentioned the cases that the system worked correctly such as after
%  being resized, getting populated, or in GTK2.

%\end{enumerate}

The example shows us that the detection of duplicate bug reports
could be based on their technical topics, rather than the concrete
words. Intuitively, topics are \emph{latent}, {\em
  semantic} features, while terms are \emph{visible, textual} features
of the documents. One could expect that the former would describe the
similarity of the documents more accurate than the latter. For
example, BR 488105 and BR 493035 describe the same topic, but they
might use \emph{different} terms for the same topic. In BR 493035, the
words \code{blank}, {\em debugging}, {\em view enhancements}, are used
to describe VM, while they do not appear in BR 488105.

%Thus, term-based assessment of those two documents might be less
%accurate/effective than topic-based assessment.

%Actually, using tfidf, a term-weighting scheme, we have calculate the
%cosine similarity of BR000002 and BR009779 to be 0.5???, too small to
%be considered as similar documents. In our approach, the topic-based
%probability that they are duplicated is estimated as 0.8???.
% topic EDIT in BR2 >> topic EDIT in BR1. (Buggy one!!!)

%Based on aforementioned observations, we propose to use a topic
%modeling approach for the automatic detection of duplicate bug
%reports. We utilize and adapt a probabilistic, generative topic model
%called {\em Relational Topic Model (RTM)}~\cite{RTM} for the analysis
%and inference of the hidden technical topics within bug reports and
%the relation of duplicate reports based on their topics. To support
%software evolution as new reports are constantly filed and new
%duplication information is available, we extend RTM into {\em
%incremental} RTM (iRTM) in which the trained model can be quickly
%updated without fully re-training.

%Next, let us detail our model.
