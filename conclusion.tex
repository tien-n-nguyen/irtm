\section{Conclusion}

We propose a probabilistic model for detecting duplicate bug
reports. 
%%Each bug report is considered as a textual document about
%%technical aspects of a system. 
Duplicate bug reports are the ones similarly describing the same buggy
technical topics. We adapt RTM to formulate the probabilistic
structures of technical aspects in a collection of bug reports and the
duplication indicators among them.
%Trained with prior data on identified duplicate reports, the model is
%used to detect not-yet-identified duplicate ones. 
We also extend RTM into iRTM in which the trained model can be quickly
updated. Our evaluation on real-world systems shows that iRTM is more
accurate and time efficient than the state-of-the-art approach in Sun
{\em et al.}~\cite{davidlo10}.

%indicators of the duplication among them based on those topic
